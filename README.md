# [BCC-Contributor](https://github.com/edwinsamodra/bcc-contributor)

## Brief Story
Someone just finished creating a website to document BCC contributors in 2022. Since the creator wanted new contributors to create PR for the first time, the author didn't write all the names of the contributors themselves. However, giving contributors the freedom to do it themselves.

## Demo
[https://bcc-contributor.netlify.app](https://bcc-contributor.netlify.app)

## Objectives

- Make a contribution to an open source project.
- Get more comfortable in using GitHub.

## Who is this for?

- This is for absolute beginners.
- It is for those with a little more experience but who want to make their first open source contribution, or get more contributions for more experience and confidence.

## Why do I need to do this?

Any web developer, aspiring or experienced needs to use Git version control, and GitHub is the most popular Git hosting service used by everyone. It is also the heart of the Open Source community. Getting comfortable using GitHub is an essential skill. Making a contribution to a project boosts your confidence and gives you something to show on your GitHub profile.
