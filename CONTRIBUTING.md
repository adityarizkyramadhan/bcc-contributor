## Introduction into Git and GitHub

If you are new to Git, GitHub and the whole open source software community, welcome! Here are some resources for getting started and understanding what it's all about.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) by Code School
- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com)

If you're not found of the command line, you can get one of GitHub's free GUI desktop apps:

- [GitHub for Mac](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)
- [GitHub for Windows](https://github.com/blog/1127-github-for-windows)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can become a Git & GitHub master with the [Git Path on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git).

## .editorconfig

You should also make use of the [.editorconfig](/.editorconfig) file found within the root of the repository. It'll make sure that your editor is setup with the same file settings.

### #YOLO JUST SUBMIT A PR

> If you come up with something really cool, and want to share it with us, just submit a PR. If it hasn't gone through the above process, we probably won't merge it as is, but if it's compelling, we're more than willing to help you via code review, design review and generally OCD nitpicking so that it fits into the rest of our codebase.
